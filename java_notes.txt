java 'static' keyword indicates that there is only a single instance of that thing anywhere.
A static method or variable can only be accessed directly by referring to the class that contains them 
and having that class call them.

For Arrays (Need   import java.util.Arrays; )
java Arrays have a property called 'length' which you can access using the dot operator (arr.length)

You can declare an array with a size ( double arr[] = new double[12]; )

You can quickly pass an array as an argument like this. ( AverageOfSubarrayOfSizeK.findAverages(5, new int[] { 1, 3, 2, 6, -1, 4, 1, 8, 2 }); )

You can take the highest possible integer value and use it with Integer.MAX_VALUE ( minLength = Integer.MAX_VALUE )
You can take the lowest possible integer value and use it with Integer.MIN_VALUE ( minLength = Integer.MIN_VALUE )

Java HashMap:

Imported as part of java.util ( java.util.HashMap )

How to instantiate ( HashMap<Character, Integer> seen = new HashMap<Character, Integer>(); )

Use the method get() in order to access a value by providing the desired key ( seen.get(str.charAt(windowStart)) )
Use the method put() in order to put a new key value pair into the HashMap ( map.put(key, newValue) )
Use the method remove() in order to remove a key value pair by providing the desired key ( seen.remove(str.charAt(windowStart)) )
Use the method replace() in order to replace a value for a certain key with a new value ( map.replace(key, newValue) )

Java String

Imported implicitly as part of java.lang (java.lang.String)

How to instantiate ( String str = "Hello world"; or str = new String("Hello World"); )

Use the method charAt() in order to access a character at a given numerical index. ( str.charAt(0); )
Use the method length() in order to get the length of the string. ( str.length(); )
