java 'static' keyword indicates that there is only a single instance of that thing anywhere.
A static method or variable can only be accessed directly by referring to the class that contains them 
and having that class call them.

For Arrays (Need   import java.util.Arrays; )
java Arrays have a property called 'length' which you can access using the dot operator (arr.length)

You can declare an array with a size ( double arr[] = new double[12]; )
